Everything has been implemented according to the post on piazza(@14) rather than the assignment guide

Please run using python3, ex: "python3 transposition-encr <textFileToEncrypt>.txt <keys>.txt"

I have included sample public/private keys, and a message to encrypt "AlicePlainText.txt" I'm guessing you'll do your own things for grading but the instructions were somewhat conflicting so I included some that I know work.
